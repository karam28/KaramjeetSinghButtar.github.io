            <p>
              With over 13 years of extensive experience in iOS development, I have honed my skills in creating robust and innovative mobile applications. My journey began as an iOS developer at Netzsmart, where I spent 2 years developing user-friendly applications and gaining a solid foundation in mobile development. This was followed by a 5-year tenure at VTNetzwelt, where I progressed from a Senior iOS Developer to an Associate Team Lead Mobile. During this time, I led multiple projects, mentored junior developers, and ensured the delivery of high-quality mobile solutions.

I then took on the role of Team Lead Mobile at Brihapstitech for 3 years, where I managed a talented team of developers, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and drove the technical direction of our mobile projects. My leadership and technical expertise contributed to the successful launch of several high-impact applications.

Currently, I work as a freelancer, delivering high-quality mobile applications solutions to a diverse range of clients. In addition, I serve as a team lead, iOS developer, and technical architect, leveraging my deep understanding of mobile technologies to design and implement cutting-edge iOS applications.

My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my approach, which includes regularly exploring Apple Documentation, attending Apple events, and utilizing platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube, and other technology-related blogs. This ensures I stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry.

I am passionate about delivering exceptional user experiences and am dedicated to driving innovation in mobile application development. My professional journey reflects a blend of technical acumen, leadership skills, and a commitment to excellence.
